## Local installation

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
2. Create a local environment file from the template:
   copy .env.example .env
   or on PowerShell:
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
3. Fill in the required environment variables.
4. Generate the Prisma client:
   npm run db:generate
5. Create the database schema:
   npm run db:migrate
6. Seed the safe demo content:
   npm run db:seed
7. Create the first admin account:
   npm run admin:create -- admin@example.com "your-strong-password" "Nexoventa Admin"
8. Start the app:
   npm run dev
9. Open the app in the browser:
   http://localhost:3000

## Environment variables

Add the following values to your .env file (do not commit this file):

- DATABASE_URL
  - Required for Prisma and database access.
  - Example: postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/nexoventa?sslmode=require
  - For Neon, use the connection string from your Neon project.

- AUTH_SECRET
  - Required for admin session signing.
  - Must be a long, random value such as a 32+ character secret string.
  - Example: replace-with-a-long-random-secret

- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
  - Public app base URL.
  - Local example: http://localhost:3000

- NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER
  - Public WhatsApp number used for click-to-chat links.
  - Example: +923555252025

## PostgreSQL / Neon setup

1. Create a PostgreSQL database in Neon or another managed PostgreSQL provider.
2. Copy the connection string into DATABASE_URL.
3. Ensure the database accepts SSL if required by your provider.
4. Run Prisma migration and generation tasks after the database is ready.

## Prisma setup

Useful commands:

- npm run db:generate
- npm run db:migrate
- npx prisma migrate deploy --config prisma7.config.ts
- npx prisma validate --config prisma7.config.ts

The Prisma schema is defined in [prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma). The project uses the Prisma 7 PostgreSQL provider and the generated client under [lib/generated/prisma](lib/generated/prisma).

## Database seed

The seed script in [prisma/seed.ts](prisma/seed.ts) creates safe, company-approved demo data only:

- Nexoventa company record context
- Medical Billing course
- September 2026 training batches
- Four training slots
- Publishable announcement content

It does not create fake student records or fabricated personal applicant information.

## Admin account creation

To create the first admin user:

npm run admin:create -- admin@example.com "your-strong-password" "Nexoventa Admin"

This writes a secure scrypt password hash to the database and creates an administrator with the ADMIN role.

## Running locally

- Start dev server:
  npm run dev
- Run lint:
  npm run lint
- Run TypeScript checks:
  npm run typecheck
- Run production build:
  npm run build

## 15-seat capacity system

Each batch stores both `capacity` and `reservedSeats` and the default capacity is 15. The application enforces the limit at the server/database layer instead of trusting frontend state.

The safety model is:

- A batch must not exceed 15 active reserved seats
- Seat reservation happens within a transaction
- The update is conditional and atomic
- A full batch is rejected before a new reservation is recorded
- Rejected or cancelled applications release reserved seats in a separate transaction
- Duplicate submissions are prevented by application-level checks

This prevents race conditions where two applicants try to claim the last seat at nearly the same time.

## Student admission flow

The application flow is:

1. Training page lists open batches
2. User chooses a month and slot
3. User fills the application form
4. Server validates all required fields
5. Server verifies the selected batch is still open
6. Database transaction reserves a seat atomically
7. Duplicate application protection runs before creation
8. Student + application records are created
9. Success response is returned to the user
10. WhatsApp follow-up link remains available

## Admin dashboard

The admin area includes protected access to:

- Courses
- Batches
- Training slots
- Applications
- Students
- Announcements

Protected routing is enforced via the signed admin session helpers in [lib/auth.ts](lib/auth.ts). The dashboard is designed for operational review and application management.

## WhatsApp integration

The public site uses a WhatsApp CTA based on the configured number in `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`. This keeps contact and follow-up flows aligned with the current business number without hardcoding the environment into app logic.

## Deployment

Before deployment:

- Set the production DATABASE_URL
- Set a production AUTH_SECRET
- Set NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
- Set NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER
- Run migrations in the target environment
- Ensure the app builds successfully with `npm run build`

Do not deploy until the required production environment variables are configured.
